A React daily planner project I'm using as a means to focus on and practice full-stack development.

On a single day, the app should have one main column where plans can be made for the day and another
column with what actually happened in reality that day. How well can you stick to your plan? This app should
help in recognising pit-falls, bad habits, or maybe poor or over-optimistic planning.

Additionally, for each day I wish the app to include a food diary section, simply to help manage your diet. 
You're more likely to question each thing you're ingesting if you've got everything you've eaten for 
the day displayed in front of you, well... this works in an ideal world!

Down the line it would be cool to find out whether FitBit provide an API to display your steps for the day
in the notes section of the planner app. Additionally, whether Monzo provide an API to display your 
spending for the day. I suspect they don't..., but they may do...! It would be particularly cool to have 
everything you wish to track and plan for a day personally in one place.
